        <strong>Browser Notes</strong>
        <div>
            - Only tested on Firefox 26.0 and Chrome 32.<br/>
            - Browser width was 1600px.<br/>
            - Chrome does't appear to calculate the anchor area correctly when it is rotated. The
              edge "further away" from the view has an inactive/dead area between it and the center
              of the cover. If you click in this area the currently selected cover loses focus and
              no new cover gets focus.
        </div>
        <br/>

        <strong>Implementation Notes</strong>
        <div>
            - Focus is used to track the selected node.<br/>
            - An upside is that it simplifies the HTML.<br/>
            - A downside is that when the browser loses focus the selected cover loses focus.<br/>
            - Instead of using focus to track the selected node, an alternative is to use radio
              buttons with associated labels. <a href='#TODO'>An example can be found here.</a>
        </div>
        <br/>

        <strong>Single, variable perspective; Javascript is used to change the perspective origin and position</strong>
        <div>
            - This coverflow is a combination of the "Single, variable perspective; Javascript is
              used to change the perspective origin" and "Single, static perspective; Javascript is
              used to position the selected cover under the perspective origin" examples.<br/>
            - The perspective origin is positioned in front of the selected cover and the selected
              cover is centered.

        <div id="single-variable-perspective-and-position" class="cover-container"></div>
