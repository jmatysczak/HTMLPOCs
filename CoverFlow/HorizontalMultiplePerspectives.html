        <strong>Browser Notes</strong>
        <div>
            - Only tested on Firefox 26.0 and Chrome 32.<br/>
            - Browser width was 1600px.
            - Chrome does't appear to calculate the anchor area correctly when it is rotated. The
              edge "further away" from the view has an inactive/dead area between it and the center
              of the cover. If you click in this area the currently selected cover loses focus and
              no new cover gets focus.
            - Firefox doesn't appear calculate the anchor location correctly. This makes the covers
              unclickable. So you have to tab through the covers.
            - Firefox doesn't calculate the rotation transition correctly. This causes the cover to
              first jump or transition to the default rotation and then jump or transition to the
              final rotation. A jump or transition occurs depends on which way the covers are being
              navigated.
        </div>

        <strong>Multiple perspectives; no Javascript</strong>
        <div>
            - This coverflow has multiple perspectives - one for each cover.
            - It only users HTML and CSS for this effect.<br/>
            - However, it has issues as noted above.
        </div>
        <div id="multiple-perspectives"></div>

        <script>
            var coversHTML = "";
            for(var i = 1; i <= 16; i++) coversHTML += "<a href='#' tabindex='1' style='z-index:-" + i + ";'><span style='background-image:url(images/" + i + ".jpg);'></span></a>";
            document.getElementById("multiple-perspectives").innerHTML = coversHTML;
