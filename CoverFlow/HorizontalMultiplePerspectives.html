                This controls how far away the covers are from the viewer.
                You'll notice that the covers in the middle look good and the ones on the ends look a little skewed.
                This is due to there being only one perspective. So the effect on the ends doesn't look as good because of the perspective.
                Also, I don't see a difference between the below line and "-webkit-perspective: 800px;"
