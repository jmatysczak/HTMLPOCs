                You'll notice that the covers in the middle look good and the ones on the ends look a little skewed.
                This is due to there being only one perspective. So the effect on the ends doesn't look as good because of the perspective.
                Also, I don't see a difference between the below line and "-webkit-perspective: 800px;"

        <strong>Browser Notes</strong>
        <div>
            - Only tested on Firefox 26.0 and Chrome 32.<br/>
            - Chrome does't appear to calculate the anchor area correctly when it is rotated. The
              edge "further away" from the view has an inactive/dead area between it and the center
              of the cover.
        </div>
        <br/>
        <strong>Single, static perspective; no Javascript</strong>
        <div>
            - This coverflow has a single, static perspective and uses no Javascript for the effect.<br/>
            - You'll notice that the selected cover has increasing spacing on the side closer to
              the center as the position of the cover gets further from the center.<br/>
            - This is the same effect as watching a car go by. When it is directly in front of you
              only the side of the car can be seen. As the car approaches or departs, you see a
              combination of the side and either the front or the back.
        </div>
        <div id="single-static-perspective" class="cover-container"></div>
        <strong>Single, variable perspective; Javascript used to change the perspective</strong>
        <div>
            - Same as above except that the perspective is changed to "match" the cover with focus.<br/>
        </div>
        <div id="single-variable-perspective" class="cover-container"></div>
        <script>
            var items = "",
                imageCount = 16;
            for(var i = 1; i <= imageCount; i++) {
                items += "<a href='#' class='cover' style='background-image:url(images/" + i + ".jpg)' tabindex='1'></a>"
            }
            document.getElementById("single-static-perspective").innerHTML = items;
            document.getElementById("single-variable-perspective").innerHTML = items;
        </script>
    </body>
